This would be an alfred workflow to switch magic accessories based on email/shared file (very inefficient) but im out of options due to the nature of connectivity allowed on all my devices.
1. Benchmark performance with a shared gdrive folder.
2. Maybe add local network discovery using https://developer.apple.com/bonjour/ for those who can use it.
3. device identifification and email cleanup.
4. use a non GUI based email cli to make it faster.
